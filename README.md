<p>This is my solution to the CS50 "Inheritance" problem set, implemented in C. You can find the full problem description <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/5/inheritance/">here</a>.</p>
Problem Overview
<p>In this problem set, I developed a program that simulates the inheritance of blood types through multiple generations. Using a data structure for family members, the program recursively generates family trees and assigns blood type alleles to simulate real-world inheritance patterns across generations.</p> <p>This solution was completed as part of <strong>CS50: Introduction to Computer Science</strong>. Uploading my solution to GitHub complies with CS50’s academic honesty policy.

Program Structure
<ul> <li><strong>Family Structure</strong>: Each person in the family tree is represented by a struct containing pointers to their parents and two blood type alleles.</li> <li><strong>Inheritance Simulation</strong>: The program creates family trees recursively, simulating inheritance by randomly assigning alleles to represent genetic variation.</li> <li><strong>Memory Management</strong>: The program allocates memory for each family member and frees it after use to prevent memory leaks.</li> </ul>
Key Steps:
<ol> <li><strong>Define Family Tree Structure</strong>: Each person is represented by a struct containing alleles and pointers to parent structs.</li> <li><strong>Recursive Generation</strong>: The program builds a family tree of a specified generation depth, recursively creating and linking family members.</li> <li><strong>Random Allele Assignment</strong>: Alleles are randomly assigned based on each person's parents to simulate the process of genetic inheritance.</li> <li><strong>Print Family Tree</strong>: Displays each generation’s blood types, illustrating inheritance through the family structure.</li> <li><strong>Memory Cleanup</strong>: Uses post-order traversal to free each family member’s memory and prevent memory leaks.</li> </ol> <p>Note: This repository does not include any files provided by CS50, such as Makefiles or sample inputs.</p>
